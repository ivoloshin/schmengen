# schmengen
A completely vibed project. Schengen-Schmengen is a visual 90/180 visa calculator featuring a drag-and-drop timeline, real-time rolling window analysis, and "Safe Start" zones to prevent overstays. Built as an offline-capable PWA with full localization in 8 languages (including joke Yiddish).
